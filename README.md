### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marion, 
I have a PhD in bioinformatics and 6 years of experience in data generation, processing, analysis and visualization in Python and R programming languages. I completed my profile with new skills in Machine and Deep learning thanks to a bootcamp in artificial intelligence development (by Le wagon).
